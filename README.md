# 🚀 Welcome to Our Uni Group Project!

We’re just a bunch of students trying to turn ☕ + 💡 into code that actually works.  
This repo is where chaos meets collaboration™.

## The Vibe
- **Code**: sometimes elegant, sometimes spaghetti 🍝  
- **Commits**: 50% bug fixes, 50% “oops” 🙈  
- **Goal**: make something that actually *runs* before the deadline 🏃💨
